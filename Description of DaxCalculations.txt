### **Structural Description and Explanation of DAX Measures**

Below is an explanation of each DAX measure created for the task, its purpose, and how it was implemented in simple, easy-to-understand terms.

---

#### **1. Total Net Sales**
**Measure:**
```DAX
Total Net Sales = SUM('Dataset'[Sales])
```

**Purpose:**
This measure calculates the total sales revenue by summing up all the values in the **Sales** column of the dataset.

**Implementation:**
- The `SUM` function adds up all sales values in the dataset.
- This measure provides a single number that represents the overall revenue.

---

#### **2. Total 9ltr Volume**
**Measure:**
```DAX
Total 9ltr Volume = SUM('Dataset'[Volume 9ltr]) / 12
```

**Purpose:**
This measure calculates the total **9-liter equivalent** volume sold. The division by 12 converts the original units (possibly smaller volumes) into standardized 9-liter units.

**Implementation:**
- `SUM` is used to aggregate all values in the **Volume 9ltr** column.
- Dividing by 12 standardizes the values to reflect cases of 9 liters.

**Why Divide by 12?**
The original data might be in smaller units or bottles, and dividing by 12 ensures consistency in reporting by converting to standard cases.

#### **3. Total Customer**
**Measure:**
```DAX
Total Customer = DISTINCTCOUNT('Dataset'[Customer Account])
```

**Purpose:**
This measure counts the unique number of customers.

**Implementation:**
- `DISTINCTCOUNT` ensures only unique customer accounts are counted, avoiding duplicates.
- This measure highlights the total customer base over the selected period.

---

#### **4. Gained Accounts**
**Measure:**
```DAX
Gained Accounts = 
COUNTROWS(
    EXCEPT(
        VALUES('Dataset'[Customer Account]),
        CALCULATETABLE(
            VALUES('Dataset'[Customer Account]),
            DATEADD('Calendar'[Date], -1, YEAR)
        )
    )
)
```

**Purpose:**
This measure calculates the number of **new customers (gained accounts)** by comparing customers in the current year with those from the previous year.

**Implementation:**
1. `VALUES`: Extracts the unique customer accounts for the current year.
2. `CALCULATETABLE` and `DATEADD`: Extract the unique customer accounts from the previous year by shifting the date back by 1 year.
3. `EXCEPT`: Compares the two lists and returns customers that are in the current year but **not** in the previous year.
4. `COUNTROWS`: Counts the number of rows (gained customers) from the comparison.

---

#### **5. Lost Accounts**
**Measure:**
```DAX
Lost Accounts = 
COUNTROWS(
    EXCEPT(
        CALCULATETABLE(
            VALUES('Dataset'[Customer Account]),
            DATEADD('Calendar'[Date], -1, YEAR)
        ),
        VALUES('Dataset'[Customer Account])
    )
)
```

**Purpose:**
This measure calculates the number of **lost customers** by identifying those who were present in the previous year but are not in the current year.

**Implementation:**
1. `CALCULATETABLE` and `DATEADD`: Extract the unique customer accounts from the previous year.
2. `VALUES`: Extracts the unique customer accounts for the current year.
3. `EXCEPT`: Compares the two lists and returns customers that are in the previous year but **not** in the current year.
4. `COUNTROWS`: Counts the number of rows (lost customers) from the comparison.

---

#### **6. Customer Variance by Month**
**Measure:**
```DAX
Customer Variance by Month = DISTINCTCOUNT('Dataset'[Customer Account]) - 
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT('Dataset'[Customer Account]),
    DATEADD('Calendar'[Date], -1, YEAR)
)
```

**Purpose:**
This measure calculates the **change in customer count** (net variance) for the current month compared to the same month in the previous year.

**Implementation:**
1. `DISTINCTCOUNT`: Counts the number of unique customers in the current month.
2. `CALCULATE` and `DATEADD`: Counts the number of unique customers in the same month of the previous year by shifting the date back by 1 year.
3. Subtraction: The difference between the current year’s and last year’s customer counts gives the **net variance**.

---

#### **7. Cumulative Net Sales**
**Measure:**
```DAX
Cumulative Net Sales = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM('Dataset'[Sales]),
    DATESYTD('Calendar'[Date])
)
```

**Purpose:**
This measure calculates the cumulative (year-to-date) total sales.

**Implementation:**
1. `SUM`: Aggregates the sales values.
2. `DATESYTD`: Automatically sums up sales from the beginning of the year up to the selected date.
3. `CALCULATE`: Adjusts the filter context to apply the year-to-date calculation.

---

#### **8. Sales Variance by Month**
**Measure:**
```DAX
Sales Variance by Month = 
SUM('Dataset'[Sales]) - 
CALCULATE(
    SUM('Dataset'[Sales]),
    DATEADD('Calendar'[Date], -1, YEAR)
)
```

**Purpose:**
This measure calculates the difference in sales for the current month compared to the same month in the previous year.

**Implementation:**
1. `SUM`: Calculates the total sales for the current month.
2. `CALCULATE` and `DATEADD`: Calculates the total sales for the same month in the previous year.
3. Subtraction: The difference provides the sales variance.

### **Approach to Implementation**
1. **Understanding Requirements:** The goal was to measure customer and sales performance metrics, like gained/lost accounts, total sales, and variances, over a defined time range.
2. **Using Time Intelligence:** Leveraged functions like `DATEADD`, `DATESYTD`, and `CALCULATETABLE` to handle year-over-year and cumulative calculations efficiently.
3. **Simplifying Data Analysis:**
   - Used `VALUES` and `EXCEPT` to compare customer lists for gained and lost accounts.
   - Aggregated metrics like sales and customer counts using simple functions (`SUM`, `DISTINCTCOUNT`) where possible.
4. **Dynamic Context:** Applied `CALCULATE` to modify the default filter context, allowing comparisons and cumulative calculations.
5. **Focus on Clarity:** Ensured each measure had a clear purpose and built on the data model with minimal complexity.

### **Potential Improvements for Future Use**
1. **Automating Data Refresh:**
   - Implementing Power Query with dynamic M code for automated data updates when new datasets are added.
   - Directly integrating with the client’s ERP system via APIs or connection strings for real-time data updates.
2. **Validating Results:** Setting up test cases or visuals to verify the accuracy of calculations as new data is introduced.
3. **Questions for the Client:**
   - How frequently is new data available (monthly, weekly)?
   - Can we integrate directly with the ERP/database to streamline reporting?
   - What additional metrics would be valuable for decision-making?

This structured implementation ensures clarity, accuracy, and future scalability of the reports!

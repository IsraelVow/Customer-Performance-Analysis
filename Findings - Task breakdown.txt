Project Presentation: Dashboard Analysis and Recommendations

Introduction
Good morning/afternoon, and thank you for the opportunity to present this dashboard and the process behind its creation. Today, I will:
1. Walk you through the dashboard and the reasoning behind the visualizations and layout.
2. Explain the method used to transform raw data into an actionable report.
3. Suggest ways to automate and improve this reporting process.
4. Highlight some follow-up questions for better understanding and optimization.

Dashboard Overview

Key Metrics and Visualizations
Performance Metrics (Top Row Cards):  
  These cards highlight the most critical business metrics: Total Net Sales (₦551.68M), Total Customers (612), and Total 9ltr Volume (134.97K). These give stakeholders an instant summary of overall performance.

- Top 5 Customer Accounts:  
  A table displaying the top-performing customer accounts by sales, along with their average costs and total net sales. This helps prioritize key accounts.

- Net Sales by Customer Account:  
  A bar chart that breaks down sales distribution by customer. This identifies which accounts contribute the most to revenue.

- Customer Variance and Lost/Gained Accounts by Month:  
  The line and bar charts visually track customer growth trends and retention rates. The lost and gained accounts analysis helps identify churn and new customer acquisition trends.

- Sales Variance by Month:  
  A column chart showing sales fluctuations over time, offering insights into seasonal trends.

Data Preparation: From Raw to Report

To transform the raw dataset into this dashboard, the following steps were carried out using Power Query:

1. Data Ingestion
   - Source Data: Monthly sales data was imported from the ERP system, spanning March 2020 to February 2021.
   - Challenges: Inconsistent formats and missing values.

2. Data Cleaning and Transformation
   Using Power Query, the following steps were performed:
   - Removed Errors: Rows with missing or invalid data were filtered out.
   - Split Columns: Columns with combined data types (e.g., dates and text) were separated for clarity.
   - Renamed Columns: To ensure consistent and meaningful naming conventions.
   - Created Relationships: Mapped customer accounts to a calendar table for time-based calculations.
   - Generated Calculated Columns:
     - Monthly Totals: Aggregated key metrics like sales and customer counts.
     - Lost/Gained Customers: Derived by comparing customer lists year-over-year using measures.

3. Data Modeling
   - Created a Star Schema to optimize performance, separating   Fact Tables   (e.g., sales data) and   Dimension Tables   (e.g., calendar, customers).
   - Defined relationships between tables to enable complex measures and slicer functionality.

      Automation and Scalability  

To ensure the dashboard can handle   new monthly data   and larger datasets seamlessly, the following automation methods are suggested:

     1.   Power Query Automation with M Code  
   - Use   dynamic parameters   in M Code to update queries automatically when new data is added to the ERP system.
   - Example: A query that dynamically loads all files from a folder (e.g., monthly CSV exports) without needing manual intervention.

     2.   ERP System Integration  
   - Directly connect Power BI to the ERP database using:
     -   APIs  : Allowing real-time data fetches.
     -   Connection Strings  : For direct access to the database, eliminating the need to manually import data files.

   - Benefits:
     -   Reduced Manual Work  : Eliminates the need to download, clean, and load data.
     -   Real-Time Insights  : Ensures the dashboard reflects the latest performance metrics.

     3.   Automated Refresh  
   - Enable scheduled refresh in Power BI to ensure data is updated regularly (e.g., daily or weekly).
   - Use Power BI   Gateway   for seamless connectivity with on-premise or cloud-hosted ERP systems.

      Follow-Up Questions for the Client  

To further improve this reporting process, I would recommend asking the following questions:

1.   ERP Data Details  :
   - What database does the ERP system use? (e.g., SQL Server, Oracle, etc.)
   - Does the system support APIs or direct database connections for data extraction?

2.   Reporting Frequency  :
   - How often do you need this dashboard updated? (e.g., daily, weekly, or monthly)

3.   Additional Data Needs  :
   - Are there any other datasets (e.g., inventory, marketing, or financial data) you'd like to integrate for a more comprehensive analysis?

4.   User Roles  :
   - Who will use this dashboard? Should we add user-specific views or permissions?

5.   KPI Alignment  :
   - Are there additional KPIs or metrics you'd like to track (e.g., customer retention rate, profitability per customer)?

6.   Scalability  :
   - Are there plans to expand the dataset? If so, should we account for future data sources now?

      Conclusion  
This project demonstrates how i transformed the raw data into actionable insights while ensuring scalability and automation. By implementing the suggested improvements, we can provide a more dynamic and efficient reporting experience. Additionally, with answers to the proposed questions, we can refine the process to align better with the organization’s needs.

Thank you! I’m happy to take any questions or discuss next steps.
